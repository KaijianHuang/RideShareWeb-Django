        <p><strong>Ride Share Web</strong></p>
        <p>This ride share system is mainly designed for users to
            request, drive for, and join rides</p>
        <p>Ride Owner – When a user requests a ride, he/she becomes the owner of that ride. Requesng
            a ride should involve specifying a desnaon address, a required arrival (date & me), the
            number of total passengers from the owner’s party, and oponally, a vehicle type and any other
            special requests1
            . A request will also indicate whether this ride can be shared or not – a shared
            ride can be joined by other users (ride sharers). A ride owner would be able to modify a ride
            request up unl it is confirmed (a ride becomes confirmed once a driver accepts the ride and is
            in route). A ride is open from the me it is requested unl that point. A ride owner can also
            view ride status unl the ride is complete (a ride becomes closed once a driver finishes the ride
            and marks it as complete).</p>
            <p>Ride Driver – A user can register as a driver, and in doing so will provide their name along with
            their vehicle informaon. The vehicle informaon includes the type, license plate number,
            maximum number of passengers, and oponally any other special vehicle info
            1
            . To simplify, a
            driver can only have 1 vehicle. A driver can search for open ride requests based on the ride
            request aributes. A driver can claim and start a ride service, thus confirming it. A driver can
            also complete rides that they service aer reaching the desnaon to indicate that the ride is
            finished.</p>
            <p>Ride Sharer – A user can search for open ride requests by specifying a desnaon, arrival
            window (the user’s earliest and latest acceptable arrival date & me) and number of passengers
            in their party. The user can then become a ride sharer, by joining that ride. A ride sharer can
            also view the ride status, similarly to a ride owner. Finally, a ride sharer can edit their ride status
            as long as the ride is open.</p>
